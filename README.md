## Introduction
This is the repository is collection of jupyter notebooks for CARLA simulation environment for autonomous driving. The project is developed using Python and CARLA simulation environment. The project is developed as a part of the Google Hackathon @Devpost.

## Utilities
### 1. image_verifier.ipynb
Playground notebook for setting up camera configuration and openCV. OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. 

### 2. video_data_collector.ipynb
Playground notebook for collecting video data from the CARLA simulation environment. The notebook uses the CARLA Python API to collect video data from the simulation environment.

## Stage_0.ipynb
This notebook is the first stage of the project. The notebook is used to setup the CARLA simulation environment and the Python API. The notebook is used to setup the environment and showcase communication between CARLA and GEMINI. The api integration code is written in [Node JS Codebase](https://github.com/pritisolanki/gemini_api). 
In stage 0 we are controlling forward motion by applying throttle and brakes based on the traffic signal state.
